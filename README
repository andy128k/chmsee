Introduction
============

ChmSee is an HTML Help viewer for Unix/Linux.

Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/chmsee

From 2.0, ChmSee becomes to a xulrunner application. I think this
migration will bring some interesting features which provided by
xulrunner to ChmSee and make developing more fun.

Building
========

In this new version of ChmSee, most codes use cross-platform languages:
xul, javascript, css and dtd, and they do not need to build. But
ChmSee still depend on CHMLIB to retrieve book contents from a CHM
file, so there now a XPCOM component named libxpcomchm.so written in
C++ require to be compiled.

The source code of libxpcomchm.so located in ./src directory. To
successfully compile this XPCOM component, you need have xulrunner-sdk
and chmlib installed.

Then in the ./src directory, choose one of Makefile.${OS} files and
rename it to Makefile. If there is not a proper Makefile.${OS} file,
you can copy Makefile.sample and modify the INCLUDE and LIB variables
according to your building system.

When the Makefile is ready, run `make` command in this ./src
directory, a libxpcomchm.so file and its xpt defines will be generated
to the components folder.

Running
=======

After building libxpcomchm.so, execute following command line in your
chmsee folder to launch the program:

$ xulrunner application.ini

Source code repository
======================

You can use git command below to retrieve developing ChmSee code:

$ git clone git://github.com/jungleji/chmsee.git
